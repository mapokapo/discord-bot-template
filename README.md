# Discord Bot Template

**You can clone this repository to your local system and start creating your bot right away!**

## Steps required:

1. Add your bot token to the `.env` file.
2. Add custom commands in the `commands/` directory.

And that's it. All that's left to do is add your bot to your server, build the project using `npm run build`, and finally run the bot server using `npm run start`.

Everything else should be explained in the `STRUCTURE.txt` file. It contains info about this project, the theory about how this project is structured, and a guide on how to create your own commands, along with some helpful notes. Good luck!
